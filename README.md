## Functions

![image](https://github.com/zzpong/Interactive-ASM-Cheats-Updater/blob/Stable-Branch/program_icon.jpg)

Now supports (same logic with cheats makers updating their codes like AOB):
- [x] Update cheat codes to other locales (if they don't rewrite the game code, then yes)
- [x] Upgrade or degrade cheat codes for all available version if no game major shift
- [x] ARM64/ARM32 cheat codes update with automatic sorting
- [x] XCZ/XCI/NSP/NSZ game packages auto extraction
- [x] Search the whole main file for code features
- [x] Update normal ASM codes
- [x] Update multiple code cave codes with preserved structures
- [x] Skip page/pageoff codes
- [x] Recognize branch codes and modify their pointer
- [x] Auto fill cheat bids when saving .txt file
- [x] Save modified .NSO file base on cheats

TODO:
- [ ] Updating codes in .rodata or somewhere else (aka. high probability breaking the new game :cold_sweat:)


## Quick Start Guide

If you need a Chinese version introduction, please refer [here](https://www.91tvg.com/thread-293794-1-1.html). 中文版请参考[此帖](https://www.91tvg.com/thread-293794-1-1.html)。

### Pre-Requisites

* Windows 10 (:heavy_check_mark:), Windows 7 (:x:), Mac/Linux (❓: rebuild required (thx to [Amuyea](https://gbatemp.net/members/amuyea.437000/)))
* No python environment required

### Downloading

Visit out [releases](https://github.com/zzpong/Interactive-ASM-Cheats-Updater/releases) page or download the [latest](https://github.com/zzpong/Interactive-ASM-Cheats-Updater/releases/tag/latest) version.

### Usage

#### Dump main file from xci/nsp/nsz game/updates (required only if version < 0.5.0)
There are lots of excellent works for you to dump the main file, like [hactool](https://github.com/SciresM/hactool), [NSC_Builder](https://github.com/julesontheroad/NSC_BUILDER), [DBI](https://github.com/rashevskyv/dbi) or [nxdumptool](https://github.com/DarkMatterCore/nxdumptool). Please choose anyone you familiar with to dump two main files:
* **Old Main File**: dump from the game which old cheat runs on
* **New main File**: dump from the game which you want to update the old cheat to

#### Load main file and copy cheat codes (or load the gamepackages (super ones excluded) directly if version > 0.5.0)
Build ID of the old main file will be shown after loading. Please make sure it is the same with the old cheat.

#### Interactively updating the cheat codes
Logs window has everything you need when updating cheat codes.
* **Generate**: Generate one code or title
* **Skip**: Skip one code or title, especially for pointer cheats.
* **Undo**: Undo the last operation.
* **Restart**: Restart the whole process.
* **Wing Length**: Decide how many asm code lines are extracted as code features before and after the target address. Supported input type like array [left_side, right_side] and integer "single_input" are listed below:

|  Type  |  Left Side  |  Right Side  |  Support Single Input  |
| :------------------: | :------------------: | :------------------: | :------------------: |
| Normal ASM code | feature lines before ASM address | feature lines after ASM address | :heavy_check_mark: | 
| Branch to code cave | feature lines before bl address | feature lines after bl address | :heavy_check_mark: | 
| Branch with target address | wing length for bl address | wing length for bl target address | :x: | 

* **Regenerate**: Useful when logs window show "address not found". Please change wing length and regenerate until single hit, or maybe double.
* **Debug**: Generate a debug folder with procedure files to show you what happend during the whole progress.

#### Save cheat codes with "SaveCHT" button


## Building from Source

### Pre-Requisites For Build
* Python 3.9
* Packages in requirements.txt
* [upx](https://github.com/upx/upx) (if bundling to one file need)
* Spec file for pyinstaller (refer [here](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/spec-files.html) for more info)

### Hints For Pre-Requisites
* Choose any python version lower than 3.9 will unleash the support of Windows 7, but not tested. Please use at your own risk.
* There is a main.spec template in project root directory, please change demanded parameters before use.

### Usage For Build

#### Install Python and upx
* Don't forget to add environment variables.

#### Download source code

#### Use any command shell you familar with to install support packages
    cd your_source_code_root_dir
    py -3.9 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Run the project
    py -3.9 __main__.py
    
#### OR build the project
    pyinstaller -F -w your_spec_name.spec --upx-dir your_upx_dir


## Trouble Shooting
1. Why my new codes doesn't work?
  
    A: On most cases, they are pointer cheat codes that can be recognized from the logs window. Please update these cheats with [EdiZon SE](https://github.com/tomvita/EdiZon-SE) or [SE tools](https://gbatemp.net/threads/se-tools-all-your-game-memory-hacking-needs-in-one-package.575131/).

2. Why my new codes break the game?

    A: Game developer will make a huge change for some specific version of games, like adding new function or improving code efficiency. In these cases, the ASM cheat codes need to be refind. 

3. Why this application repeating same title over and over again?

    A: It happened when capstone in the application failed to recognize bytes features. Here are some major reasons: zero gap in bytes file fail to work in capstone (fixed), nsnsotool decompressing command failed (fixed), application folder structure destroyed. Please re-download this application or [create an issue](https://github.com/zzpong/Interactive-ASM-Cheats-Updater/issues/new). Please note that "out of .text or code cave border" has been fixed from 0.4.0.

4. What does "main file" stand for?

    A: "main file" is the executable game file dumped from NSP or XCI, which is located in the exefs folder. It can be dumped automatically with the latest version.

5. What does "wing length" stand for?

    A: "wing length" represents the number of code lines before and after the target area. Here is the diagram for a better view:

6. What code cave remake brings between version 0.3 and 0.4?

    A: In the new version, the code cave structure strictly follows the one from the original cheat code instead of previous "relocate every code cave automatically". Therefore, code caves in cheat codes like [EXP 2X]/[EXP 4X]/[EXP 8X] will only demand identical addresses and nothing more.

7. I have fully run the program and never see any warning, but still no luck. Why?

    A: In most cases, the "master code" which has a title within "{}" takes the responsibility. Some code creater prefer use them as "default function that should run with the game start". These codes and some non "master code" titled like "recovery code" always have links with other ASM codes like "BL #0xADDR". Please add these code contents to other parts of the cheat codes that don't work properly and run the program again.
